# T-Mobile Sales Edge App - Status Report

## Current Version: 2.4.3 

## What's Actually Working ✅
1. **Step 1 - Lines Selection**: Works correctly, user can select 1-5 lines
2. **Step 2 - New Phones**: Page renders with dropdowns, but phones don't populate

## What's NOT Working ❌

### Critical Issues:
1. **Phone Selection Dropdowns Empty** 
   - The dropdowns render but have no phone options to select
   - Continue button is disabled because no phones can be selected
   - Flow cannot progress past Step 2

2. **Insurance Step Not Accessible**
   - Because flow stops at Step 2, insurance checkboxes never appear
   - Even though the code exists, users can't reach it

3. **No Access to Later Steps**
   - Trade-ins/Current Phones
   - Plan Selection  
   - Accessory Lines (Watch/Tablet)
   - Accessory Devices (New vs BYOD)
   - Results/Summary

## Pricing Corrections Made ✅

### Activation Fees (Device Connection Charges)
- **OLD**: $10 per phone line only = $30 total
- **NEW**: $35 per device (all devices) = $210 total
  - 3 phones: $105
  - 1 watch: $35
  - 2 tablets: $70

### Phone Financing  
- **OLD**: Incorrectly calculated credits
- **NEW**: Correct Verizon switch credits
  - Pro Max 512GB: $1,399 - $1,100 = $299 ÷ 24 = $12.46/mo
  - Pro 256GB: $1,099 - $1,100 = $0/mo (full credit)

### Monthly Total
- **Service**: $200 (3 lines Experience Beyond with AutoPay)
- **Phones**: $12.46 (corrected from $33.21)
- **Insurance**: $54 (3 × $18)
- **Accessories**: $50 (Watch $10 + 2 iPads @ $20 each)
- **Taxes/Fees**: $48.35
- **TOTAL**: $364.81/month (was $385.56)

### Upfront Total

- **Device Taxes**: $251.79
- **First Month**: $364.81
- **TOTAL**: $826.60 (was $702.35)

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix Phone Dropdown Population**
   - Debug why phoneData isn't populating the select options
   - Ensure Continue button enables after selection

2. **Test Complete Flow End-to-End**
   - Verify all 8 steps work sequentially
   - Confirm data passes correctly between steps
   - Validate final calculations match corrected pricing

3. **Verify Calculations**
   - Ensure optimizerFixed.js is being used everywhere
   - Confirm all activation fees calculate correctly
   - Test with exact customer scenario

## Files Modified:
- `src/utils/optimizerFixed.js` - Corrected pricing logic and activation fees
- `src/components/ConversationFlowComplete.jsx` - Added missing UI steps
- `src/AppComplete.jsx` - Using correct components

## Testing Results:
- Manual test shows flow stops at Step 2
- Phone dropdowns don't populate
- Cannot reach insurance, accessories, or results
- Pricing calculations corrected but can't be verified in UI

## Deployment Status:
- Version 2.4.3 deployed but still has critical UI issues
- Users cannot complete a quote due to Step 2 blockage
