# CORRECTED PRICING CALCULATION

## Your Exact Scenario:
- 3 lines from Verizon (no trade-ins)

- Insurance on all 3 phones
- 1 existing Apple Watch (BYOD - line only)
- 2 existing iPads (BYOD - lines only)

## CORRECTED Monthly Costs:

### Service Plan (Experience Beyond)

- AutoPay discount: -$30
- **Service subtotal: $200/month**

### Phone Financing (with Verizon Switch Credits)
- iPhone 17 Pro Max 512GB: $1,399 - $1,100 credit = $299 ÷ 24 = **$12.46/mo**
- iPhone 17 Pro 256GB #1: $1,099 - $1,100 credit = **$0/mo** (full credit)
- iPhone 17 Pro 256GB #2: $1,099 - $1,100 credit = **$0/mo** (full credit)
- **Phone financing total: $12.46/month**
