# T-Mobile Application Fix List

## Critical Issues Found

After thoroughly analyzing the T-Mobile application, I've identified several critical issues affecting calculations, flow, and user experience. Here's a comprehensive fix list organized by priority:

## ðŸ”´ PRIORITY 1: Critical Calculation Issues

### 1. Insurance Calculation Not Using Proper Pricing
**Location**: `src/utils/optimizerFixed.js` lines 275-281
**Issue**: Insurance is hardcoded at $18/month instead of using device-specific pricing from `insuranceData.js`
**Fix Required**:
```javascript
// CURRENT (WRONG):
monthlyInsurance = insuredLines * 18; // Hardcoded $18

// SHOULD BE:
let monthlyInsurance = 0;
this.customer.devices.forEach(device => {
  if (device.insurance && device.newPhone) {
    const insuranceInfo = insurancePricing.getInsurancePrice(device.newPhone);
    monthlyInsurance += insuranceInfo.monthly;
  }
});
```

### 2. Accessory Line Pricing Not Calculating
**Location**: `src/utils/optimizerFixed.js` - `calculateAccessoryCosts()` method
**Issue**: Watch and tablet line costs not properly added to monthly bill
**Fix Required**:
- Import and use `accessoryLinePricing` from `insuranceData.js`
- Add watch line cost: $5/month (with Experience Beyond) or $12/month (standard)
- Add tablet line cost: $5/month (with Experience Beyond) or $20/month (standard)

### 3. Plan Pricing Calculation Issues
**Location**: `src/utils/optimizerFixed.js` lines 49-84
**Issue**: Complex logic for calculating total plan cost based on line count
**Fix Required**:
- Simplify by using total pricing directly from `plans_sept_2025.js`
- Ensure AutoPay discount is properly applied ($10/line for Experience, $5/line for Essentials)

## ðŸŸ¡ PRIORITY 2: Flow & User Experience Issues

### 4. Insurance Step Not Always Showing
**Location**: `src/components/ConversationFlowComplete.jsx`
**Issue**: Insurance step may be skipped in certain flows
**Fix Required**:
- Ensure 'insurance' step always comes after 'newPhones' selection
- Make insurance selection mandatory (even if user declines)

### 5. Accessory Device Selection Missing
**Location**: `src/components/ConversationFlowComplete.jsx`
**Issue**: When user selects watch/tablet lines, no prompt for device selection
**Fix Required**:
- Add device selection for watches (Apple Watch models)
- Add device selection for tablets (iPad models)
- Include financing options for accessory devices

### 6. Tax Calculations Inconsistent
**Location**: Multiple files using different tax rates
**Issue**: Tax rates defined in multiple places with different values
**Fix Required**:
- Centralize all tax calculations to use `taxConfig.json`
- Ensure consistent application of South Florida tax rates

## ðŸŸ¢ PRIORITY 3: Display & Summary Issues

### 7. Summary Page Missing Insurance Details
**Location**: `src/components/ConversationFlowComplete.jsx` - summary case
**Issue**: Insurance selections not shown in summary
**Fix Required**:
- Display insurance cost per device
- Show total monthly insurance cost
- Include Protection 360 features

### 8. Results Display Not Showing All Costs
**Location**: `src/components/ResultsDisplayEnhanced.jsx`
**Issue**: Missing breakdown of accessory lines and insurance
**Fix Required**:
- Add insurance line item to monthly breakdown
- Add accessory line costs separately
- Show device connection fees for all devices

### 9. Trade-In Values Not Properly Applied
**Location**: `src/utils/optimizerFixed.js` - `calculateDeviceCosts()`
**Issue**: Trade-in credits not correctly reducing device financing
**Fix Required**:
- Ensure trade-in values from `phoneData.js` are properly applied
- Show trade-in credit clearly in results

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Family Plan with Insurance
- 4 lines
- Mix of iPhone and Samsung devices
- 2 devices with insurance
- Watch and tablet accessories
- Expected: Correct monthly total with all components

### Test Case 2: Single Line with Trade-In
- 1 line
- iPhone 17 with trade-in
- Insurance selected
- No accessories
- Expected: Trade-in credit applied, insurance added

### Test Case 3: Couple Plan with Accessories
- 2 lines
- Both new phones
- One watch, one tablet
- No insurance
- Expected: Accessory line costs included

## Success Criteria

âœ… All phone line costs calculate correctly based on number of lines
âœ… Insurance costs use device-specific pricing from insuranceData.js
âœ… Accessory line costs (watch/tablet) are added to monthly bill
âœ… Trade-in values properly reduce device financing
âœ… Tax calculations are consistent and accurate
âœ… User flow is logical and complete
âœ… Summary page shows all selections and costs
âœ… Results display complete breakdown of all charges

## Notes

- The main issue is that calculations are partially hardcoded instead of using the proper data files
- Insurance pricing varies by device tier ($7-$25/month) but is hardcoded at $18
- Accessory line costs are defined but not being added to calculations
- The flow works but needs refinement to ensure all options are presented

## Next Steps

1. Start with Priority 1 fixes (calculation issues)
2. Test each fix thoroughly before moving to next
3. Run full end-to-end tests after all fixes
4. Deploy using `npm run deploy` to trigger auto-update
