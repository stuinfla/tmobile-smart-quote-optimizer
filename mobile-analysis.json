    "âœ… Version display is correct (shows full 2.6.12)",
    "ðŸ”§ Gear button STILL overlaps footer - needs to be moved up by at least 75px",

    "\nðŸŽ¨ UI IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:",
    "1. The first screen asks \"Are you a current T-Mobile customer?\" - this could be combined with lines selection",
    "2. Consider a single screen: \"New or Existing Customer?\" + \"How many lines?\" in one view",
    "3. The gear button could be moved to top-right corner to avoid footer entirely",
    "4. Add a progress indicator showing steps remaining"
